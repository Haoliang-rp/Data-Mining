TheK_Shinglesclasstakesinthepure-textdocumentsandnumberofshingle as the initialization parameters. The object _k_shingle stores the shingled documents in the list and object dict_ creates a mapping strategy for the shingles appears in the all the documents to the simple integer, thus minimize the memory used for storage. The get_hash_shingle method maps the shingles in each document to its corresponding hashing integers and is returned as a new list. The compare_sets method computes the Jaccard similarity of two hashed documents.
